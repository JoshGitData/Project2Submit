		<h2>Lesson1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
		<div class="subhead">
		      <h3>How the web Works</h3>
		        Computers communicate with each other over the internet.
		        <em>HTTP Request</em> to <em>server</em>. Server responds 
		        with document or image to the <em>web browser</em> of the 
		        user's pc.
		        For example, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works">this link 
		   </a> demostrates this concept.
		</div>
		
		<div class="subhead">
		    <h3>HTML</h3>
		  <p>
		    HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em>HTML
		    documents form the majority of the content on the web.
		    HTML documents contain <em>text content </em> which decribes
		    "what you see"  and <em>markup</em> which decribes "how it looks".
		  </p>
		</div>
		<div class="subhead">
			<h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
		  <p>
		  HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
		    writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by
		    using HTML <b>tags</b>. 
		  </p>
		</div>
		<div class="subhead">
	      	<h3>Why Computers are Stupid</h3>
	      <p>
	      	Computers interpret instructions literally. A small programming mistake can cause huge problems
	      	in the program.
	      </p>
	    </div>
	    <div class="subhead">
	    	<h3>Inline vs. Block Elements</h3>
	      	<p>
	      		HTML element are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
	      		Block elements form an invisible box around their content.
	      	</p>
	     </div>
	</div>
	<div class="lesson">
	       <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
	       <div>
	       	 	<h3>Developer Tools (in the browser)</h3>
	       	 <p>
	       	 	HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
	       	 </p>
	       </div>
	    <div class="subhead">
	       <h3>The tree-like structure of HTML</h3>
	      <p>
	      	The tree-like structure, like a family-tree with the elements
	      	acting as mother and children. In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes.
	      </p>
	    </div>
	    <div class="subhead">
	       <h3>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</h3>
	      <p>
	      	WHen you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave
	      	of changing indentations going up and down the left side
	      	of the document. The more indented an element is, the more 
	      	deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.
	      </p>
	    </div>
	    <div class="subhead">
	       <h3>Text Editors (for Coding)</h3>
	      <p>
	      	When coding, special text editors are used.
	    </div>

	    	<h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML</h2>
	    <div class="subhead">
	       <h3>What is CSS</h3>
	    		<p>
	    		CSS has rules. The most specific rules applies to every element.
	    		CSS uses a computer science principle called inheritance.
	    		</p>
	    </div>
	    <div class="subhead">
	       <h3>AVOID REPETITION! - Use Selectors!</h3>
	           	<p>
	           	 There several types of selectors. BASIC, COMBINATORS, PSEUDO,
	           	 to name a few. Using selectors and classes helps organize and sub-group your code so that it may be reused in a efficient way. Avoiding repetition saves time and could save computing resources. For more info please see documentation on the mozilla developer network
	           	 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors">site.</a>
	           	</p>
	    </div>
	    <div class="subhead">
	        <h3>Utilize the Box Model</h3>
	        	<p>
	        	  A web page is made up of boxes. Per the box model: Content, Padding, Border, Margin.
	        	  Keep in mind how different browsers will render your code. 
	        	</p>
	    </div>
	    <div class="subhead">
	        <h3>Code, Test, Refine</h3>
	            <p>
	              Code, boxify, position. Look for natural boxes. Look for repeated styles
	              and semantic elements. Code HTML. Apply styles from the biggest to smallest.
	              Then fix.

	 	<h1>Important Concept - Telling Computers What to Do</h1>
	 </div>
	<div class="lesson">
	  	<h2>Lesson 1: What is an Computer Program</h2>
	  	<div class="subhead">
	  		<h3>Computer Program</h3>
	  		The program instructs the hardware (e.g. computer) what to do. A very precise sequence of steps are prescribed.
	  	</div>
	  	<div class="subhead">
	  		<h3>Programming Language</h3>
	  	 <p>
	  	 	Python is an interpreter programming language. A web browser, python code, calendar app on a phone are examples of programs that can be made by a computer programming language. Due to the ambiguity and verbosity of natural languages, its better to use a computer language. 
	  	 </p>
	  	</div>
	  	<div class="subhead">
	  		<h3>Misc. Programming Info</h3>
	  	   <p>
	  	   	Compilers are programs that produces other programs. A compiler does all the work at once then run the program.
	  	   	Programming mistakes are called bugs.
	  	   </p>
	  	</div>
	</div>
	<div class="Lesson">
	  	<h2>lesson 2: Functions, Functions, Whats your Function</h2>
	  	<div class="subhead">
	  		<h3>What are Functions</h3>
	  	  <p>
	  	  	Functions or procedures take inputs (aka. parameters, operands, arguments) then makes outputs (i.e. return, print, etc.). Python has built-in functions and the ability to create custom functions.
	  	  </p>
	  	</div>
	  	<div class="subhead">
	  		<h3>How, When, and Why Functions</h3>
	  	  <p>
	  	  	In Pyhton the 'def' keyword denotes and proceeds a function. name ('input', 'input'...): , then followed by the body of the function. Every line must be indented. If output is desired then a return statement must be used. To call a function is to use the function. The good thing about functions is that they help programmers avoid needless repetition.
	  	  </p>

	  	<div class="subhead">
	  		<h3>Other Programming Tools and Concepts</h3>
	  	  <p>
	  	  	Variables are names that allow programmers to refer values to items and keep track of them. We initiate a variable by making an assignment statement: name = Expression. The name is on the left side and value on the right. Variables can vary. Once we define a variable it can change and refer to a new name.
	  	  </p>
	  	  <p>
	  	  	A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. Indexing allows us to extract substrings within a string.
	  	  </p>
	  	  <p>
	  	  	IF and WHILE statements are very powerful tools for parts of code that require decisions and repetitions.
